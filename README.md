# Deaconn (Rebuilt)
**Warning** - New website still *under development* and **no public preview available** at this moment.

This is the rebuilt Deaconn website that will be transforming Deaconn into a publisher instead of a resume/blog for Christian Deacon.

## Features
* Full Markdown support for anything that involves text content.
* A blog.
* Services with the option for payments.
* Submit requests for an existing service or request a new service to be made (free-lancing).
* User profiles including about me, experiences, and skills. This will be similar to a resume.

## Credits
* [Christian Deacon](https://github.com/gamemann)
